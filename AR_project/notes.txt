Absolute idiot's guide to installing OpenCV on Ubuntu 12.04:

To Do (ideas):
-----------------
1. consider detecting all cameras and picking the "right" one:

2. setup coroutines or task scheduler so that I can run multiple tasks simultaneously at different frequencies
3. make myDeviceID a global variable

Notes:
-----------
1. Note about timing:
    The timing of different methods is a bit wonky. Each method has its own "frequency" which is how often that method
    is called. main() is running at 100 Hz. So a method with a frequency of 10 Hz would run every 100/10 = 10 cycles.
