 Getting Started
-------------------
Absolute idiot's guide to installing OpenCV on Ubuntu 12.04:

To Do (ideas):
-----------------
1.  [ ] consider detecting all cameras and picking the "right" one:
        http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9645784/opencv-counting-cameras
2.  [ ] setup coroutines or task scheduler so that I can run multiple tasks simultaneously at different frequencies
3.  [ ] make myDeviceID a global variable
4.  [X] use erosion/dilation to remove any text on page when doing blob tracking
5.  [ ] Read more about Hough Lines: http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/hough.htm
6.  [ ] Read Hu papers
7.  [ ] Replace Hough Transform with cvFitLine: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14184147/detect-lines-opencv-in-object
8.  [ ] move all tuning parameters into global
9.  [X] for submethods that return Mat, figure out how to determine if submethod fails (i.e. if Mat == NULL ??)
10. [ ] Canny + Hough(80) + kMeans(4) is working pretty well for line detection.
        However, consider making robust by comparing lines w/ corner detection.
11. [ ] create cmake file for makefile
12. [ ] when doing the overlay, try to color map the ovelay image to the whitespace of the original image

Notes:
-----------
1. Note about timing:
    The timing of different methods is a bit wonky. Each method has its own "frequency" which is how often that method
    is called. main() is running at 100 Hz. So a method with a frequency of 10 Hz would run every 100/10 = 10 cycles.
