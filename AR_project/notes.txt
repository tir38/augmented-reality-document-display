 Getting Started
-------------------
Absolute idiot's guide to installing OpenCV on Ubuntu 12.04:

To Do (ideas):
-----------------
1. consider detecting all cameras and picking the "right" one:
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9645784/opencv-counting-cameras
2. setup coroutines or task scheduler so that I can run multiple tasks simultaneously at different frequencies
3. make myDeviceID a global variable
4. use erosion/dilation to remove any test on page when doing blob tracking
5. Read more about Hough Lines: http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/hough.htm
6. Read Hu papers
7. Replace Hough Transform with cvFitLine: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14184147/detect-lines-opencv-in-object

Notes:
-----------
1. Note about timing:
    The timing of different methods is a bit wonky. Each method has its own "frequency" which is how often that method
    is called. main() is running at 100 Hz. So a method with a frequency of 10 Hz would run every 100/10 = 10 cycles.



LEFT OFF: I've been using c methods, i need to switch to c++ methods. First start off replacing existing methods
